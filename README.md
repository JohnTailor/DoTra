Domain Transformer: Predicting Samples of Unseen, Future Domains
----------------------------------------------------------------

This approach predicts samples with labels(!) from unseen domains. Other approaches (e.g., from unsupervised domain adapation) can only label samples from (unseen) domains. 
It learns a transformer that can transform between target domains.
